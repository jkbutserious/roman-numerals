# Roman Numerals

#### Arabic to Roman numeral conversion program, 6.11.2020

#### By Jeff Kim and Deryck Jackson

## Description

This program accepts user input in the form of Arabic numerals from 1 to 3999 and converts it to Roman numerals. The resulting numeral conforms to the universally accepted [Standard form of Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#%22Standard%22_form) and follows these basic rules:

* The values of consecutive symbols are added together (II === 2)
* Consecutive symbols are limited to 3, after which, subtractive logic is employed (IV = 4)
* Ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands are separated (99 === XCIX, not IC)
* Because of the preceding constraints, the upper limit of Roman numeral notation is 3999, due to the lack of a symbol for the value of 5000

## Specs

1. Code should recognize numbers and output the appropriate Roman numeral expression
Example Input: "1"
Example Output: "I"

2. Code should express numbers as sums of Roman numeral symbols
Example Input: "6"
Example Output: "VI"

3. Code should express numbers as subtractions of Roman numeral symbols
Example Input: "9"
Example Output: "IX"

4. Code should reject non-numeral input
Example Input: "C9"
Example Output: "Please input a value using numbers"

5. Code should separate Roman numeral expressions into groups of ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands
Example Input: "1111"
Example Output: "MCXI"
